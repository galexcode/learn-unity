cube-theory is my first attemp at Unity, this project does:
* creates project from scratch
* imports custom images
* `ctrl+shift+n` to create empty nodes as the logic grouping node 
* have fun with built-in normal map shader
* creates new skybox material from six sky faces and attach skybox component to the camera
* creates the world and player with built-in cubes and spheres
* attach particle system component to the player
* attach collidable attributes to the player
* make player responsible to keyboard events
* display 2d text
